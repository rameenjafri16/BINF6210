hello 

#when updating github: 
#1. save file
#2. commit! you can do this from the small git button on the top of this screen, or from the commit option on the git tab on the environmental variables panel (below). 
#3. this will open up the changes page !! make sure you select the right project (the one youre uploading to github). 
#4. also select "staged" (its autoset to unstaged which is useless I think)
#5. write a little comment explaining what you did, and then you can actually commit (this is like getting engaged) 
#6. after this you can push (which is like getting married) 
#7. then you can close it lol
